        "Have a knack for selling things online? Many small shops and artisans in our cities want to join the e-commerce boom but need help. You could offer to set up their online store or handle their social media marketing. It’s a big opportunity: a recent report says India’s online shopping market hit about $60 billion in annual sales:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}, making it the world’s second-largest online shopper base. That means millions of people are buying online. You can help a local store upload products to Amazon or Shopify, manage UPI payments, and even design eye-catching ads. Think of it like being a digital shop assistant — all it takes is your guidance and a laptop."

        "Broken smartphone or a laggy laptop? In our city life, that’s as common as traffic jams. Instead of wasting time at a repair shop, city folks love on-demand service. In fact, one Mumbai startup offers to pick up your phone, fix it, and drop it back to you or we can say to your booked place— no long waits! You could start a similar service for gadgets: phones, tablets or even printers. Just partner with tech-savvy friends or local repair centers. Customers book a slot online, and you come fix things at their door. It’s like having your own personal IT guy."

India has Urban Company already, but there’s room for more specific apps. Maybe an app just for pet grooming at home, or one that handles office maintenance. Imagine launching a service platform where people can schedule AC repairs, home cleaning, or even laundry pick-up all through your website or app. Busy metro-goers would love the convenience, and you earn a commission on each booking."

Korean startup Balance Hero tapped into this, launching an app called True Balance in India that got 60 million downloads. That shows how much we love easy money apps. You could build something similar for our needs: maybe an app to split bills among friends, manage group expenses, or help local vendors accept UPI payments. Even a simple service like automatic bill reminders or budget trackers could catch on. The key is making daily money tasks frictionless on a phone."

Start by helping people you know, then grow your mini business from there. With so many connected city customers, there’s always someone who needs a little digital help. The trick is to pick one idea, give it a shot, and keep improving. Who knows? A small app or service you start today might become the next big thing we all use over our evening chai."
