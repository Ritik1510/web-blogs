    "Monsoon brings relief from the summer heat and a chance to refresh our terrace gardens. City dwellers in India are turning small balconies into green retreats, much like people in Japan and Korea do. This rainy season, pick plants that thrive on rain and humidity for a lush and healthy terrace.",
    "Choosing the right plants is key. We’ll explore seven top picks that love the monsoon weather, from colorful flowers to edible vines. These plants often appear in Asian gardening traditions – for example, Japanese gardeners grow vines like bitter gourd as a “green curtain” for shade, and many Koreans use indoor verandas for herb gardens."

        "Don’t forget the shade-loving leafy plants! Easy vines like the money plant (pothos) flourish in moist, humid conditions. Hardy houseplants such as Boston ferns also thrive in the monsoon’s humidity. (Even peace lilies, another tropical favorite, appreciate warm rains.)

        "Marigolds (genda) are monsoon-friendly flowers that add bright color. They’re hardier than many blooms, resisting common fungal problems in humid weather. With minimal care, marigolds will keep flowering through the rains if planted in well-draining soil. Plus, they help repel pests naturally – a bonus for any garden."

        "Vine crops thrive in the rain, and bitter gourd is a great example. This Indian favorite loves the moist monsoon climate and can grow up a trellis to save space. (In Japan, a similar vine called goya is famously grown as a “green curtain” on balconies.) You’ll get both cooling shade and fresh veggies – a win-win. Just be sure to support the vines and harvest often for best results."

        "Turmeric is a powerhouse plant for terrace gardens. Planted as small rhizomes, it enjoys steady moisture but needs well-draining soil to avoid rot. Give it a few months and you’ll harvest fresh haldi – nature’s own immunity booster. Turmeric’s big leaves create a lush look, and it fits well in pots alongside other terrace plants."

        "Remember to prepare your pots well. Always use rich, well-draining soil and containers with drainage holes so excess rain can escape.

Above all, enjoy the process – your terrace can become a lush, green retreat in the rainy season if you choose the right plants."
